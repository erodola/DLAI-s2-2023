In this notebook we will use the hugging face GPT2 pre-trained model.\n","\n","The main ideas adopted to obtain state-of-the-art results are two:\n","\n","1. More and better data \n","2. More transformer blocks stacked, i.e. more parameters\n","\n","### Architecture\n","\n","GPT2 is a language *generation* model that employs the masking to impose causal relationships. GPT2 stacks 48 transformer blocks, a sequence lengths of 1024 and an embedding dimension of 1600: resulting in 1.5B parameters.\n","\n","### Auto-regressive decoding\n","In Language Models after each token is produced, the token is added to the sequence of inputs to condition the following token prediction. This process is called *auto-regression*. The *auto-regressive* language generation assumes the probability distribution of a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next-word distributions: \n","$$ P(w_{1:T} | W_0 ) = \\prod_{t=1}^T P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_0) $$\n","with $W_0$ the initial *context* word sequence. The length $T$ corresponds to the timestep $t=T$ at which the EOS token is generated from $P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_{0})$.\n","\n","Together with data and parameters, **better decoding methods** have also played an important role. The Language Models yields a probability distribution over the language: **how can we decode this distribution into a sentence in our language?**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rtZ-D7MLrDmE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683528039543,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":20766,"user":{"displayName":"Irene
