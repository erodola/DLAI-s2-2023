### Pre-requisites

Python fundamentals; calculus; linear algebra.

### Textbook and reading material

Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.

In addition, [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2022/raw/main/resources/Course_notes_Crisostomi.pdf) you can find some supplementary course notes.

### Grading

Evaluation proceeds according to the following steps:

- A midterm self-evaluation test (optional, does not concur to the final grade)
- A final written exam (**mandatory**, accounts for 60% of the final grade)
- A project (**mandatory**, accounts for 40% of the final grade)
- An oral exam (optional, attributes at most 3 points, added to or subtracted from the final grade)

We may require an oral exam in doubtful cases or whenever necessary.

Here you can find some example sheets of past written exams:
