### News
- **26/04/2023:** The **midterm sheet** is now published. Students who wish to have their answers checked must deliver **by today at 15:00** via email (rodola@di.uniroma1.it).
- **19/04/2023:** The lecture of **April 25th is cancelled** due to the Liberation Day, as per the academic calendar. On **April 26th** we will do a self-evaluation test; more details will follow.
- **03/04/2023:** The lecture of **April 11th is cancelled** due to Easter holidays, as per the academic calendar.
- **27/03/2023:** The lectures of Tue 28 and Wed 29 March **will be held remotely** due to illness. _Tue 28_: The notebook will be uploaded shortly, and you can work on it from your homes; the Professor and the teaching assistants will be on the Discord server during the 3 hours, to assist you in real time. _Wed 29_: The slides are already up, together with a video recording of the Professor explaining the new topic; the recording is from DLAI 2021, which overlaps well with the new slides up to some simplifications.
- **11/02/2023:** The course website is online. Welcome to DLAI 2022/23! **The course will start on Tue 28th February**.

### Logistics

**Lecturer:** Prof. Emanuele Rodol√†

**Assistants:** Dr. Antonio Norelli, Dr. Luca Moschella, Dr. Marco Fumero

**When:** Tuesdays 13:00--16:00 and Wednesdays 13:00--15:00

**Where:**

Physical classrooms: Aula Magna Edificio C RM111 (Tuesdays) and Aula Alfa RM062 (Wednesdays)

There is no virtual classroom, and the lectures will not be recorded.

**Q & A:** We will use a [Discord](https://discord.com/) server. More details during the first lessons.

### Pre-requisites

Python fundamentals; calculus; linear algebra.

### Textbook and reading material

Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.

In addition, [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2022/raw/main/resources/Course_notes_Crisostomi.pdf) you can find some supplementary course notes.

### Grading

Evaluation proceeds according to the following steps:

- A midterm self-evaluation test (optional, does not concur to the final grade)
- A final written exam (**mandatory**, accounts for 60% of the final grade)
- A project (**mandatory**, accounts for 40% of the final grade)
- An oral exam (optional, attributes at most 3 points, added to or subtracted from the final grade)

We may require an oral exam in doubtful cases or whenever necessary.

Here you can find some example sheets of past written exams:
